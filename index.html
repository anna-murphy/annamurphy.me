            The first World War, ironically also called the War to End All Wars, resulted in an estimated 40 million deaths. It is fundamentally impossible for us mere human beings to truly understand the impact of the deaths of that many people: each person has their own story, their own family, interests, aspirations, fears, and wishes. And to think that most of that was wrought in just four short years.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            It is a stretch of the imagination to think that this much death, this much destruction, and this much horror wouldn’t cause a major backlash. After World War One, it took the form of the rise in popularity of the existentialist movement and a rebellion against the assumptions people had been making for the past centuries. Franz Kafka was one of these people and throughout his work, toed the line between philosophy and art. In his work Couriers (sometimes translated as Messengers) Kafka is simultaneously expressing his frustration with both the objective waste of human life and people’s insane adherence to rules.	        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            Couriers is only five sentences long. Like Hemingway's famous “For sale: baby shoes, never worn” Couriers aims to project a feeling and a message onto the reader in words not chapters. While writing in this style is creatively admirable, the work should not be held to any less of a philosophical standard. Kafka consciously chose terseness over clarity. This does have the effect of making his intent difficult to determine, but it also lends itself to being interpreted as art, and not a structured argument. This makes Couriers more akin to haiku than to a work of fiction or philosophical diatribe: the primary focus is the feeling expressed and the consumer’s interpretation.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            With this in mind, we can take a look at the time of publication (about 1917) and notice the almost undeniable tie to World War One. Living in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Kafka saw, year after year, his fellow citizens march off to the trenches to be mowed down in droves. The Hapsburg Empire ended up losing 1.5 million of their subjects and some smaller countries associated with them lost (in the case of Serbia) as much as 20% of their total population. The obvious question Kafka asked was why more and more people kept going to the front lines only to die gruesome and horrific deaths? Kafka’s answer, especially as illustrated in this piece, was their blind adherence to the rule of law.        
        </p>

        <p class="garbageable">
            The last sentence of this story is especially powerful. Putting the idea almost in black and white terms, it is difficult not to hear the disgust pouring out of the text as Kafka paints a picture of desperation and abject pain. The titular couriers wish they could die but cannot “...because of their oaths of service.” With this, Kafka imparts the knowledge that it is the courier’s fault, and no one else’s, that they suffer.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            Bringing this back down the ladder of abstraction and reapplying Kafka’s odium for abstract oaths to the First World War, Kafka is no longer berating his kinsmen for fighting and joining the ranks of souls lost to needless violence, but pleeding for them not to do so. When he says in the beginning of this piece that the characters were given the “choice between becoming kings or the couriers of kings” Kafka is saying to those same people that they do not have to fight. They can reject the authority they have been arbitrarily placed under and become the kings they are not.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            But Kafka goes further than this. In the world he has constructed, not only did all the characters choose to forego kingship in favor of the role of the courier, but there are fundamentally no kings. They are running around shouting meaningless words, delivering fake and empty messages, and all the while too terrified to stop because of the oath they made. But oath to what? To whom? In the physical world he lives in, he sees the bureaucrats doing the same thing as the common folk: following orders (implicit or explicit) given by either real people of societal expectations and never making any thoughts for themselves.        
        </p>

        <p class="garbageable">
            All of this said, art is by no stretch of the imagination the end all and be all of reality. All of Kafka’s experiences and thoughts are so colored by the people that came before him and the events he lived through. Kafka, in some respects, is just an echo of those thinkers that came before him (Kierkegaard and Nietzsche to name a few), but in others he was able to provide another perspective.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            To say that any authority should be rebelled against is difficult to defend, and to say as much would be to not understand Kafka’s point. Like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, Kafka appears to be more concerned with the fact that each person is consciously making their own decisions. Kafka desperately wants each and every person to move past the stage Nietzsche describes as analogous to that of a camel. Kafka illustrates this more with doomsday fictions depicting what happens when we do not do this. In this piece, the remaining people in existence wish for a death that cannot come, and in The Trial Kafka illustrates what happens when no one questions the spinning of the wheels of bureaucracy.        
        </p>
        
        <p class="garbageable">
            With this in mind, Kafka is being a little melodramatic. So few of us people have truly become individuals (as Kierkegaard put it), have slain the dragon named “Thou Shalt” (as Nietzsche put it), or broken their oaths of service (as Kafka put it) that if a doomsday scenario as described in either The Trial or Couriers would have happened as a result, we would be living it. And while we may be living it indeed, there are so few people running around shouting meaningless messages from kings that do not exist wishing for a death that cannot come that none may realize the reality in which we live.        
        </p>

        <p class="garbageable">
            Instead of a warning like some would like to interpret Kafka, let us instead view it as a plea. A hope from a man long dead that we can follow our own desires and dreams, and a wish from the same mind that people will not throw themselves into trenches of mustard gas because someone told them too.
